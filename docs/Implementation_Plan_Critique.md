## Critical Architectural Errors

### 🔴 ERROR 1: i_transport Interface Fundamentally Wrong

**Location**: Lines 308-419 (Change 1: Extract Transport Interface)

**Problem**: The plan proposes creating `i_transport : public i_marshaller`, which is **architecturally incorrect**.

**From Q&A (Q12)**:
> **i_marshaller Interface**: THE interface through which ALL inter-zone and pass-through communication must rely
>
> **Current Implementers**:
> 1. **service_proxy**: Derives from `i_marshaller`
> 2. **i_service** (service class): Also derives from `i_marshaller`

**Correction**:
- **Service derives from i_marshaller** (NOT i_service - no such interface exists per Q&A Q3)
- **Service_proxy implements i_marshaller** for routing
- **Pass_through implements i_marshaller** for routing
- **Transport does NOT implement i_marshaller** - it's a hidden implementation detail

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> Service Sink is a concept that may **only exist within the implementation of a particular transport**. It is NOT a separate class in the RPC++ core architecture.
>
> How it works:
> 1. Transport unpacks message from wire
> 2. Transport calls `i_marshaller` interface (either directly OR via transport-internal service_sink helper)
> 3. That `i_marshaller` is one of:
>    - **service** (for local dispatch) - derives from i_marshaller (no i_service interface exists)
>    - **pass_through** (for routing to opposite service_proxy) - also implements i_marshaller

**Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - The entire transport abstraction is based on wrong interface hierarchy.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 2: Service Sink is NOT a Core Class

**Location**: Lines 545-694 (Change 3A: Service Sink Architecture)

**Problem**: The plan treats `service_sink` as a **core RPC++ class** that services manage. This contradicts Q&A findings.

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> With further thought: Service Sink is a concept that may **only exist within the implementation of a particular transport**. It is NOT a separate class in the RPC++ core architecture.
>
> **Service Sink Ownership:**
> - **If a service_proxy has a service sink implementation**, that sink's lifetime should be **maintained by the service_proxy**
> - Or service sink is **part of that service_proxy's implementation**
> - Service_proxy owns/manages its associated sink (if it exists)

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> **Key Architecture Points**:
> - Service derives from i_marshaller (not i_service - no such interface exists)
> - Pass-through also implements i_marshaller
> - Transport routes to i_marshaller (could be service OR pass-through)
> - **Service_sink is transport-internal implementation detail, NOT core abstraction**

**Correction**:
- Service_sink (if it exists) is **transport-specific**
- **Service does NOT manage sinks** - transport does
- **Service is NOT aware of sinks** - only tracks service_proxies
- Sinks are **owned by service_proxy or transport**, NOT service

**From Problem Statement (Lines 982-1004)**:
> **Service Sink Ownership** (if it exists as transport-internal helper):
> - If a service_proxy has a service sink implementation, that sink's **lifetime is maintained by the service_proxy**
> - Or service sink is **part of that service_proxy's implementation**
> - Service_proxy owns/manages its associated sink
>
> **Design Principle**: Service_sink is **transport-specific implementation concern**, not a core RPC++ abstraction.

**Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Violates fundamental separation of concerns. Service should NOT manage sinks.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 3: No i_service Interface Exists

**Location**: Lines 685 (service class reference)

**Problem**: Code refers to "i_service" interface which does not exist.

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> **Note**: There is NO `i_service` interface - just `service` class that derives from `i_marshaller`

**From Q&A (Q12)**:
> **2. i_service (service class)**: Also derives from `i_marshaller`

The Q12 answer clarifies this is the **service class**, not an i_service interface. The parenthetical "(service class)" indicates this is describing the service class implementing i_marshaller, NOT an interface called i_service.

**Correction**: Replace all "i_service" references with "service" (the class).

**Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Confusion about fundamental architecture.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 4: Back-Channel Format is Wrong

**Location**: Lines 1661-1664 (Back-Channel Support)

**Problem**: States "HTTP-header style key-value pairs" which contradicts Q&A.

**From Q&A (Q10)**:
> **Back-Channel Data Structure:**
> ```cpp
> struct back_channel_entry {
>     uint64_t type_id;          // Fingerprint ID from IDL
>     std::vector<uint8_t> payload;  // Arbitrary binary data
> };
>
> // Back-channel is vector of entries
> std::vector<rpc::back_channel_entry> back_channel_data;
> ```
>
> **Key Properties**:
> - **Type Safety**: `type_id` is fingerprint generated by IDL parser for unique structure identification
> - **Pass-Through Semantics**: RPC++ transports back-channel data without interpreting payload contents
> - **Binary Safe**: Payload can contain any binary data

**Correction**: Use `vector<rpc::back_channel_entry>` structure, NOT HTTP headers.

**Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Wire protocol incompatibility.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 5: Transport Mode Requirements Incorrect

**Location**: Lines 487-501 (Symmetrical Service Proxy Pairs creation)

**Problem**: Assumes all transports can create bidirectional connections the same way.

**From Q&A (Q13)**:
> **Transport Compatibility:**
>
> | Transport | Sync Mode | Async Mode | Notes |
> |-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
> | Local (in-process) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Direct virtual calls |
> | SGX enclave | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Supports both modes |
> | DLL calls (future) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Not implemented, supports both |
> | SPSC | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Requires pump tasks |
> | TCP | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Requires I/O scheduling |

**From Q&A (Q13b)**:
> **Current Implementation:**
> 1. **Global build flag**: `BUILD_COROUTINE` in `CMakePresets.json`
> 2. **Controls definitions in**: `rpc/include/rpc/internal/coroutine_support.h`
> 3. **Changes behavior** of all classes and interfaces throughout entire codebase
> 4. **Single namespace**: All code builds either sync OR async (not both simultaneously)

**Correction**: Transport creation must account for bi-modal vs coroutine-only requirements.

**Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Implementation won't work in synchronous mode for Local/SGX/DLL.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 6: Circular Dependency Design Flaw (Plan A)

**Location**: Lines 185-300 (Entity Relationship Design)

**Problem**: Plan A proposes a 4-object circular dependency with complex reference counting.

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> **Pass-Through Reference Counting Responsibility:**
>
> **Critical Design Question**: How is reference counting maintained in a pass-through?
>
> **Answer**: The **pass-through should be responsible** for reference counting. This design has important implications:
>
> 1. **Pass-through controls lifetime of its service_proxies**
> 2. **Pass-through controls all method execution**
> 3. **Pass-through maintains single reference count to service**
> 4. **service_proxy may not need lifetime_lock_**

**Problem with Plan A**:
- Creates 4 objects: 2 sinks + 2 proxies
- Circular dependency with alternating chain
- Complex weak_ptr ↔ shared_ptr promotion based on counts
- Race conditions managing counts across 4 objects

**Correction**: Per Q&A, **pass-through is responsible for reference counting**, not a chain of 4 objects with circular dependencies.

**Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Plan A violates established requirement that pass-through manages reference counting.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 7: Missing Both-or-Neither Guarantee

**Location**: All three plans (A, B, C) - none implement this requirement

**Problem**: None of the plans address the critical both-or-neither operational guarantee.

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> **Critical Operational Guarantees:**
>
> 1. **Both-or-Neither Service Proxy Operational State**
>    - Pass-through **guarantees that BOTH or NEITHER** of its service_proxies are operational
>    - Cannot have asymmetric state (one proxy operational, other destroyed)
>    - Ensures bidirectional communication always possible or completely unavailable
>    - Prevents partial failure modes where only one direction works
>
> 2. **Transport Operational Check for clone_for_zone()**
>    - **If transport is NOT operational**, `clone_for_zone()` function **must refuse** to create new service_proxies for that transport
>    - Prevents creating service_proxies that cannot communicate
>    - Ensures newly cloned proxies are viable from creation
>    - Avoids race condition where proxy created during transport shutdown

**Missing from all plans**:
- How to guarantee both service_proxies are operational together
- How `clone_for_zone()` checks transport operational status
- How to prevent asymmetric states

**Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Violates explicit requirement from Q&A clarifications.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 8: Zone Termination Transport Responsibility Missing

**Location**: Lines 632-680 (service_sink dispatch_call method)

**Problem**: Only shows service_sink handling zone termination, but transport must also handle it.

**From Q&A (Q9)**:
> **Transport responsibility**:
> - Transport logic decides if connection is **dead vs just slow**
> - Configured by service proxy specialization initialization parameters
> - Transport detects hard failure and triggers cascade cleanup
> - **Transport responsibility**: Transport must pass Zone Termination notification to service AND to any relevant pass-throughs

**From Q&A (Q9)**:
> **Multiple Transports Per Service:**
> A service may have **multiple transports**. Examples:
> - A zone may have several different SGX enclaves (one transport each, with each having several service proxies)
> - Several TCP transports to other zones (with each having several service proxies)
> - Mix of local, SGX, and TCP transports simultaneously

**Missing**:
- Transport detection of connection failure
- Transport broadcasting zone_terminating to service AND pass-throughs
- Handling multiple transports per service

**Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Incomplete shutdown protocol.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 9: channel_manager.service_proxy_ref_count_ is Subject to Change

**Location**: Lines 1505-1519 (Unified Transport Lifecycle Management)

**Problem**: Relies on `service_proxy_ref_count_` pattern from channel_manager.

**From Q&A (Q2)**:
> **SPSC Specifically:**
> - Parent creates SPSC queues for child
> - Queue addresses passed privately inside transport mechanism (hidden from user)
> - Each zone has its own `channel_manager` object pointing to the shared queues
> - `channel_manager.service_proxy_ref_count_` tracks how many service_proxies share this channel
>   - **Note**: This reference counting mechanism is **subject to change** in future designs

**Correction**: Do NOT rely on this pattern - it's explicitly marked as potentially changing.

**Impact**: 🟠 **MAJOR** - Design may become obsolete.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 10: Multiple Service Proxies Can Share ONE Transport

**Location**: Lines 74-97 (Principle 2: Symmetrical Bidirectional Pairs)

**Problem**: Assumes one-to-one mapping between service_proxy and transport.

**From Q&A (Q2)**:
> **Transport Sharing:**
> - **Multiple service proxies can share ONE transport**
> - Example: Zone A might have service_proxy(A→B, caller=A) and service_proxy(A→B, caller=C) both using same TCP socket
> - Sink on receiving side disambiguates which (destination, caller) pair the message is for

**Correction**: Transport is shared by multiple service_proxy pairs, NOT one transport per pair.

**Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Fundamental misunderstanding of transport sharing.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 11: Pass-Through add_ref Handling Unknown

**Location**: Lines 914-949, 1386-1398 (add_ref in Plans B and C)

**Problem**: Plans mark add_ref as "TODO: Investigate" but Q&A provides guidance.

**From Problem Statement (Lines 964-969)**:
> **Impact on add_ref**:
> - **Investigation Required**: `add_ref()` may need special handling for forking scenarios
> - Current assumption: Route same as `send()`
> - Potential issue: Special forking logic might require delegation to service instead of simple routing
> - **TODO**: Investigate if `add_ref` needs to call service for special forking behavior

**From Q&A (Q6)**:
> **What Makes add_ref Special:**
> - **send() and add_ref() are not the SAME** (`call` and `send` are different names for same purpose)
> - The "forking" happens when **object references are passed across zones**
> - Root doesn't know about Zone 7, but needs to establish routing when object is returned
>
> **IMPORTANT CORRECTION:**
> - **send() and add_ref() are NOT the same** - this was a misunderstanding
> - **send/call** are the same (different names for RPC method invocation)
> - **add_ref** has different purpose: increment shared/optimistic reference count
>   - Mode 1: Add +1 to existing service proxy/sink for known object
>   - Mode 2: Share object reference to a different ZONE (complex operation)
>   - Mode 3: Three modes defined by `add_ref_options` (build_caller_route, etc.)

**Correction**: add_ref is fundamentally different from send - it can create new service_proxies when sharing objects to new zones. This needs design, not just "TODO".

**Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Core functionality not designed.

---

### 🔴 ERROR 12: Routing Proxy Definition Still Unclear

**Location**: Lines 1749-1843 (Scenario 1: Routing/Bridging Service Proxies)

**Problem**: Plan doesn't define what a "routing proxy" actually is.

**From Q&A (Q14)**:
> **Routing Proxy Definition Needed:**
>
> **Question**: What exactly IS a "routing proxy" or "pass-through proxy"?
> - Is it: service_proxy where `zone_id != caller_zone_id`?
> - Or: service_proxy with zero objects but non-zero reference counts from other zones?
> - **Terminology needs clarification**

**Missing**: Clear definition based on data, not just "zero objects".

**Impact**: 🟠 **MAJOR** - Implementation ambiguity.

---

## Major Inconsistencies with Q&A

### 🟠 INCONSISTENCY 1: Service Tracks Sinks

**Location**: Lines 698-707 (Service Lifecycle Management with Sinks)

**Problem**: Claims service only needs `other_zones` map, but earlier says service manages sinks.

**Contradiction**:
- Line 700: "// ONLY collection needed - simple!"
- Lines 585-694: service_sink code shows service managing sinks

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> **Service_sink is transport-internal implementation detail, NOT core abstraction**
> - Service doesn't know about sinks
> - Transport owns sinks

**Impact**: 🟠 **MAJOR** - Internal contradiction in plan.

---

### 🟠 INCONSISTENCY 2: Transport vs Channel Terminology

**Location**: Throughout document

**Problem**: Mixes "transport" and "channel" terminology inconsistently.

**From Q&A (Q2)**:
> **Transport Sharing:**
> - **Multiple service proxies can share ONE transport**
> - Each zone has its own `channel_manager` object pointing to the shared queues

**Clarification**:
- **Channel manager**: SPSC-specific implementation
- **Transport**: Generic abstraction
- Should use "transport" consistently, mention channel_manager only for SPSC

**Impact**: 🟠 **MAJOR** - Confusing terminology.

---

### 🟠 INCONSISTENCY 3: Proactive vs Reactive Creation

**Location**: Lines 1560-1601 (Change 5: Eliminate Y-Topology Race Condition)

**Problem**: Proposes "proactive proxy notification" but doesn't match Q&A guidance.

**From Q&A (Q6)**:
> **The Problem:**
> - Creating reverse proxies **reactively during send()** is inefficient
> - On-demand proxy creation happens in critical path (race condition noted at line 239)
> - Complex logic scattered between `send()` and `add_ref()`
> - Comment at line 246 suggests: "perhaps the creation of two service proxies should be a feature of add ref and these pairs should support each others existence by perhaps some form of channel object"
>
> **Key Insight**: The Y-topology bug fix reveals that **bidirectional service proxy pairs** should be created together, not asymmetrically on-demand.

**Problem with proposed solution**:
- Still creates routing proxies on-demand (via notification)
- Just moves the "reactive" creation from send() to notification handler
- Doesn't create bidirectional pairs together

**Correction**: Bidirectional pairs created together when add_ref shares object to new zone.

**Impact**: 🟠 **MAJOR** - Doesn't solve the root problem.

---

### 🟠 INCONSISTENCY 4: Synchronous Mode Post Messaging

**Location**: Lines 1608-1642 (Change 6: Fire-and-Forget Messaging)

**Problem**: No discussion of how post() works in synchronous mode.

**From Q&A (Q13)**:
> **Synchronous Mode (BUILD_COROUTINE=OFF):**
>
> 1. **All i_marshaller methods become BLOCKING**
>    - `CORO_TASK(int)` → `int`
>    - `CORO_TASK(void)` → `void`
>    - Fire-and-forget `post()` becomes **blocking call**
>    - **This is why async is valuable** - posts are not scalable in synchronous mode
>
> **Post messaging may need to be curtailed**
> - Some post messaging logic may need different handling in sync mode
> - **To be determined** - design decision needed

**Missing**: How does fire-and-forget work when calls are blocking?

**Impact**: 🟠 **MAJOR** - Incomplete design for synchronous mode.

---

### 🟠 INCONSISTENCY 5: Service Derives from i_marshaller

**Location**: Lines 1282-1308 (Service as i_marshaller Handler in Plan C)

**Problem**: Plan C correctly shows service deriving from i_marshaller, but Plans A and B don't.

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> **Relationship Between Components:**
> - **Service**: Represents the zone - derives from i_marshaller, manages object stubs and service_proxies
>   - **Note**: There is NO `i_service` interface - just `service` class that derives from `i_marshaller`

**Correction**: All plans must show service deriving from i_marshaller consistently.

**Impact**: 🟠 **MAJOR** - Inconsistency across plans.

---

### 🟠 INCONSISTENCY 6: Transport Hidden Implementation Detail

**Location**: Lines 308-476 (Change 1: Extract Transport Interface)

**Problem**: Proposes making transport a public interface with lifecycle methods.

**From Q&A (Q2)**:
> **Transport Sharing:**
> - Transport is **hidden implementation detail** of service_proxy
> - Queue addresses passed privately inside transport mechanism (**hidden from user**)

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> **Service_sink is transport-internal implementation detail, NOT core abstraction**

**Correction**: Transport should be internal to service_proxy, not a public interface that services interact with directly.

**Impact**: 🟠 **MAJOR** - Violates hiding principle.

---

### 🟠 INCONSISTENCY 7: Optimistic Reference Semantics

**Location**: Lines 1682-1704 (Child Service Shutdown Conditions)

**Problem**: Correctly states incoming optimistic refs don't prevent shutdown, but doesn't clarify object stub vs object proxy distinction.

**From Problem Statement (Lines 186-222)**:
> **Critical Lifecycle Distinction**:
> ```
> Object Stub (remote object):
>   - Destroyed when shared_count == 0
>   - Optimistic references do NOT keep stub alive
>   - Rationale: Remote object should be destroyed when no strong references remain
>
> Object Proxy (local reference):
>   - Kept alive while (shared_count > 0 OR optimistic_count > 0)
>   - Rationale: Optimistic references keep transport alive for future use
>
> Service Proxy:
>   - Currently destroyed when aggregate ref count = 0 for all objects
>   - Aggregate = sum of (shared_count + optimistic_count) across all object proxies
> ```

**Missing**: Distinction between stub (remote) and proxy (local) lifecycle.

**Impact**: 🟠 **MAJOR** - Incomplete explanation of semantics.

---

### 🟠 INCONSISTENCY 8: Reference to Removed Lifetime Lock

**Location**: Lines 1423-1446 (Lifetime Management in Plan C)

**Problem**: Says "No self_reference_ needed" and "No is_routing_proxy_ flag needed" but Q&A already says lifetime_lock_ may be unnecessary.

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> **Pass-Through Reference Counting Responsibility:**
> 4. **service_proxy may not need lifetime_lock_**
>    - Current `lifetime_lock_` mechanism may be unnecessary
>    - Service_proxy lifetime potentially controlled by:
>      - **object_proxies** (objects referencing this proxy)
>      - **pass_throughs** (routing proxies using this proxy)
>      - **shutdown lambdas** (cleanup callbacks)
>    - No need for separate lifetime lock mechanism if these handle lifecycle

**Correction**: Clarify that Plan C builds on Q&A finding that lifetime_lock_ may be unnecessary.

**Impact**: 🟡 **MINOR** - Presentation issue, not technical.

---

## Minor Issues and Clarifications

### 🟡 ISSUE 1: TCP Reliability Requirements

**Location**: Lines 459-464 (tcp_transport class)

**Problem**: No mention of reliability requirements from Q&A.

**From Q&A (Q11)**:
> **In-Flight Call Handling on Connection Loss:**
> 1. **Retry logic**: Up to **transport configuration** set by first service proxy to instantiate it
> 2. **When connection is lost**: Transport triggers `TRANSPORT_ERROR` to any awaiting calls
> 3. **No automatic retry** at RPC layer - application decides how to respond
>
> **Reconnection Semantics:**
> 1. **All references are dropped** when connection is lost
> 2. Application can **no longer call those endpoints** - gets `TRANSPORT_ERROR`
> 3. **Application responsibility** to respond accordingly

**Missing**: Error handling and reconnection strategy in tcp_transport.

**Impact**: 🟡 **MINOR** - Implementation detail, but should be documented.

---

### 🟡 ISSUE 2: Local Transport No Serialization

**Location**: Lines 466-469 (local_transport class)

**Problem**: Comment says "Direct function calls, no serialization" but no implementation guidance.

**From User Guide (Lines 1508-1541)**:
> **Local Service Proxies (In-Process, Bi-Modal)**
> - **Direct function calls**: No serialization, native C++ objects passed directly
> - **Bi-modal**: Works in both sync and async modes

**Missing**: How to avoid serialization overhead in local transport.

**Impact**: 🟡 **MINOR** - Implementation guidance needed.

---

### 🟡 ISSUE 3: SGX Hybrid Mode

**Location**: Lines 471-476 (sgx_transport class)

**Problem**: No mention of SGX hybrid approach (sync uses ecalls, async uses SPSC).

**From User Guide (Lines 1658-1728)**:
> **SGX Enclave Service Proxies (Secure Enclaves, Hybrid Mode)**
> - **Direct SGX EDL calls**: Uses `ecall` (host→enclave) and `ocall` (enclave→host)
> - **Hybrid approach**: Initial `ecall` to set up executor and SPSC channel
> - **SPSC transport**: After setup, uses `spsc::channel_manager` for communication

**Missing**: SGX transport implementation strategy for bi-modal support.

**Impact**: 🟡 **MINOR** - Critical transport missing design.

---

### 🟡 ISSUE 4: DLL Unloading Reference Implementation

**Location**: Lines 1713-1738 (DLL/Shared Object Unloading Safety)

**Problem**: Correctly cites enclave_service_proxy as reference but doesn't show how to adapt it.

**From Problem Statement (Lines 1579-1614)**:
> **Reference Implementation**: The `enclave_service_proxy` cleanup logic should be used as reference for DLL service proxies.
>
> **Location**: SGX enclave boundary crossing code handles similar synchronization requirements:
> - Waiting for all threads to exit enclave
> - Ensuring all ecalls/ocalls complete
> - Graceful cleanup before destroying enclave

**Missing**: Concrete adaptation strategy from enclave to DLL.

**Impact**: 🟡 **MINOR** - Implementation guidance would be helpful.

---

### 🟡 ISSUE 5: Operation Serialization Overhead

**Location**: Lines 1844-1913 (Scenario 2: Concurrent add_ref/release Through Bridge)

**Problem**: Proposes per-object mutex serialization which may hurt performance.

**Alternative**: Consider operation ordering guarantees instead of full serialization.

**Impact**: 🟡 **MINOR** - Performance concern, alternative worth considering.

---

### 🟡 ISSUE 6: Sync Mode Destructor Blocking

**Location**: Lines 1953-1967 (Scenario 3: Service Proxy Destruction During Active Call)

**Problem**: Uses `coro::sync_wait()` in destructor for coroutine mode.

**Issue**: Destructors calling sync_wait can block thread arbitrarily long.

**Alternative**: Schedule cleanup task and detach from destructor.

**Impact**: 🟡 **MINOR** - Design choice with tradeoffs.

---

### 🟡 ISSUE 7: Missing OpenTelemetry Details

**Location**: Lines 1661-1673 (Back-Channel Support)

**Problem**: Mentions OpenTelemetry but no specifics.

**From Problem Statement (Lines 576-600)**:
> Back-channel Support:
> - HTTP-header style key-value pairs [NOTE: This is wrong per Q&A]
> - Optional encryption per entry
> - Native support for distributed tracing context propagation (OpenTelemetry)

**Missing**: How OpenTelemetry IDs map to back_channel_entry structures.

**Impact**: 🟡 **MINOR** - Implementation detail for later.

---

### 🟡 ISSUE 8: Security Review Mentioned Without Details

**Location**: Lines 2176, 2405 (Success Criteria)

**Problem**: Lists "Security review complete" but no security requirements defined.

**From Problem Statement (Related Protocols section)**:
> **Security Investigation** (Priority: High):
> 1. Document all DCOM security vulnerabilities
> 2. Design authentication and encryption for RPC++
> 3. Consider security implications of distributed reference counting
> 4. Plan secure channel establishment and certificate management

**Missing**: Security requirements and review criteria.

**Impact**: 🟡 **MINOR** - Important for future, not blocking current design.

---

## Missing Design Elements

### MISSING 1: Pass-Through Lifetime Management

**Problem**: All three plans (A, B, C) show different lifetime approaches but none match Q&A guidance.

**From Q&A (Q3)**:
> **Implication for service_proxy**:
> - **lifetime_lock_ mechanism may be unnecessary** with pass-through managing lifecycle
> - Service_proxy lifetime controlled by:
>   - **object_proxies** (objects referencing this proxy)
>   - **pass_throughs** (routing proxies using this proxy)
>   - **shutdown lambdas** (cleanup callbacks)

**Missing**: Clear statement that pass-through holds shared_ptr to service_proxies it routes between.

**Recommendation**: Add explicit section on pass-through lifetime management matching Q&A.

---

### MISSING 2: Known_Direction_Zone Usage

**Problem**: Y-topology solution doesn't use known_direction_zone properly.

**From Q&A (Q6)**:
> **`known_direction_zone` parameter** added to all `add_ref` signatures
> - Provides routing hint when direct route unavailable
> - Usage: `known_direction_zone(zone_id_)` indicates "path is through this zone"

**Missing**: How known_direction_zone enables routing in Y-topology scenarios.

**Recommendation**: Show add_ref using known_direction_zone to find intermediate zones.

---

### MISSING 3: Aggregate Reference Count Calculation

**Problem**: Plans don't show how aggregate ref counts are calculated across object proxies.

**From Problem Statement (Lines 205-210)**:
> **Service Proxy Lifetime**:
> - Service proxy destroyed when aggregate ref count = 0 across all object proxies
> - Aggregate = sum of `(shared_count + optimistic_count)` for all objects
> - **Problem**: Service proxy destroyed even if it's a routing proxy with zero objects

**Missing**: Code showing aggregate calculation and how it determines service_proxy destruction.

**Recommendation**: Add example showing reference count tracking.

---

### MISSING 4: Error Code Handling

**Problem**: No discussion of error_codes constants or error handling patterns.

**From Problem Statement (Lines 1361-1387 - CORBA comparison)**:
> **Message Delivery Guarantees:**
> - RPC++ guarantees **at-most-once** delivery
> - Call may be lost on disconnect (not retried automatically)

**Missing**: Error codes for various failure modes, retry strategies.

**Recommendation**: Document error_codes enum and handling conventions.

---

### MISSING 5: Telemetry Integration

**Problem**: Mentions telemetry in cleanup phase but no design.

**From Problem Statement (Lines 1616-1628)**:
> **Telemetry Integration**
> Telemetry tracks:
> - Service proxy creation/destruction
> - add_ref/release operations
> - Object proxy lifecycle
> - Zone topology
> - Child service lifecycle

**Missing**: How telemetry hooks into new architecture (Plans A/B/C).

**Recommendation**: Show telemetry callback points in design.

---

### MISSING 6: Multi-Transport Per Service

**Problem**: Designs don't show multiple transports per service.

**From Q&A (Q9)**:
> **Multiple Transports Per Service:**
> A service may have **multiple transports**. Examples:
> - A zone may have several different SGX enclaves (one transport each, with each having several service proxies)
> - Several TCP transports to other zones (with each having several service proxies)
> - Mix of local, SGX, and TCP transports simultaneously

**Missing**: How service manages multiple transports and routes to correct one.

**Recommendation**: Show service.transports_ map with multiple entries.

---

### MISSING 7: Cascading Cleanup Details

**Problem**: Zone termination shown but not cascading cleanup through topology.

**From Q&A (Q9)**:
> **Cascading impact**: If Zone 2 dies and was routing to Zones 3, 4:
> - All zones with references to 2, 3, 4 must be notified
> - Zones 3, 4 become unreachable even if they're still running

**Missing**: Algorithm for cascading cleanup propagation.

**Recommendation**: Add cascade propagation algorithm.

---

### MISSING 8: Partial Tree Survival

**Problem**: Plans don't address isolated branch termination.

**From Problem Statement (Lines 757-788)**:
> **Critical Design Principle - Isolated Branch Termination**:
> ```
> Zone Tree:
>          Root (Zone 1)
>            ├─── Branch A (Zone 2)
>            │      ├─── Leaf A1 (Zone 3)
>            │      └─── Leaf A2 (Zone 4)
>            └─── Branch B (Zone 5)
>                   └─── Leaf B1 (Zone 6)
>
> Scenario: Branch A (Zone 2) terminates
> 1. Zone 2 sends zone_terminating to: Root, Leaf A1, Leaf A2
> 2. Root cleans up proxies to Zone 2, 3, 4 (entire Branch A)
> 3. Branch B (Zone 5) and Leaf B1 (Zone 6) UNAFFECTED
> 4. Root ↔ Branch B connection remains active
> 5. Branch B continues normal operations
>
> Result: Branch A subtree removed, Branch B subtree continues
> ```

**Missing**: How partial tree cleanup works without poisoning whole topology.

**Recommendation**: Add partial tree termination algorithm.

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL CHANGES REQUIRED

1. **🔴 Remove i_transport Interface**
   - Transport is hidden implementation detail
   - Service_proxy owns transport internally
   - No public transport interface needed

2. **🔴 Remove Service_Sink as Core Class**
   - Make service_sink transport-internal (if exists at all)
   - Service does NOT manage sinks
   - Service_proxy or transport owns sinks

3. **🔴 Fix Back-Channel Format**
   - Use `vector<rpc::back_channel_entry>` structure
   - Remove all "HTTP header" references
   - Document type_id generation from IDL

4. **🔴 Add Both-or-Neither Guarantee**
   - Pass-through guarantees both service_proxies operational together
   - clone_for_zone() checks transport operational before creating proxies
   - Document prevention of asymmetric states

5. **🔴 Document Transport Sharing**
   - Multiple service_proxies share ONE transport
   - Service_proxy → transport is many-to-one, not one-to-one
   - Show transport disambiguation logic

6. **🔴 Design add_ref Handling**
   - Not just "TODO" - needs concrete design
   - May create new service_proxies when sharing objects to new zones
   - Different from send() - can fork new routes

7. **🔴 Add Zone Termination Transport Responsibility**
   - Transport detects connection failure
   - Transport broadcasts zone_terminating to service AND pass-throughs
   - Handle multiple transports per service

### MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

8. **🟠 Define Routing Proxy Clearly**
   - Is it based on zone IDs or zero objects?
   - Provide concrete definition

9. **🟠 Fix Y-Topology Solution**
   - Don't just move reactive creation to notifications
   - Create bidirectional pairs together when add_ref shares objects
   - Use known_direction_zone properly

10. **🟠 Document Synchronous Mode post()**
    - How does fire-and-forget work when blocking?
    - May need curtailment or special handling

11. **🟠 Consistent service Derives from i_marshaller**
    - All plans must show this
    - Remove all "i_service" references

12. **🟠 Keep Transport Hidden**
    - Don't expose transport as public interface
    - Transport is service_proxy implementation detail

### MINOR CLARIFICATIONS

13. **🟡 Add TCP Reliability Strategy**
14. **🟡 Document Local Transport No-Serialization**
15. **🟡 Show SGX Hybrid Mode Implementation**
16. **🟡 Adapt Enclave Cleanup for DLL**
17. **🟡 Consider Serialization Alternatives**
18. **🟡 Document OpenTelemetry Integration**
19. **🟡 Define Security Requirements**

### MISSING DESIGN ELEMENTS TO ADD

20. **Pass-Through Lifetime Management** - Match Q&A guidance
21. **known_direction_zone Usage** - Show proper Y-topology routing
22. **Aggregate Ref Count Calculation** - Code examples
23. **Error Code Handling** - Document error_codes enum
24. **Telemetry Integration** - Show callback points
25. **Multi-Transport Per Service** - Show routing to correct transport
26. **Cascading Cleanup Algorithm** - Topology-wide propagation
27. **Partial Tree Survival** - Isolated branch termination

## Plan Comparison with Corrections

| Aspect | Plan A | Plan B | Plan C | Q&A Requirement | Verdict |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **Objects per zone pair** | 4 (2 sinks + 2 proxies) | 1 (pass_through) | 2 (proxies) + 1 pass_through | Pass-through manages lifetime | Plan C closest |
| **Service_sink core class** | ❌ Yes (WRONG) | ❌ N/A (correct) | ✅ No (correct) | Transport-internal only | Plan C correct |
| **i_transport interface** | ❌ Yes (WRONG) | ❌ Yes (WRONG) | ❌ Yes (WRONG) | Hidden implementation | All wrong |
| **Service derives i_marshaller** | ❌ Unclear | ❌ Unclear | ✅ Yes | Required per Q&A Q3 | Plan C correct |
| **Transport sharing** | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | Multiple proxies share transport | All missing |
| **Both-or-neither** | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | Critical requirement | All missing |
| **add_ref design** | ❌ "TODO" | ❌ "TODO" | ❌ "TODO" | Must design, not defer | All incomplete |
| **Back-channel format** | ❌ HTTP headers | ❌ HTTP headers | ❌ HTTP headers | vector<rpc::back_channel_entry> | All wrong |
| **Sync mode post()** | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | May need curtailment | All missing |

**Recommendation**: **None of the plans are currently implementable** due to critical errors. Plan C has the best foundation but needs major corrections per above.

## Conclusion

The Implementation Plan contains fundamental misunderstandings of RPC++ architecture that must be corrected before implementation begins. The most critical errors are:

1. Treating service_sink as a core class (violates Q&A Q3)
2. Creating i_transport interface (violates hiding principle)
3. Wrong back-channel format (violates Q&A Q10)
4. Missing both-or-neither guarantee (violates Q&A Q3)
5. Missing transport sharing design (violates Q&A Q2)
6. Incomplete add_ref design (critical feature)
7. No synchronous mode post() design (required per Q&A Q13)

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT PROCEED** with implementation until these critical issues are resolved. Plan C provides the best foundation but requires significant corrections to align with Q&A findings and Problem Statement requirements.
