This is the original rpc/remote_pointer.h implementation that works on windows and linux, it was a rush job and copied lots of code from different sources to make the thing work.  However it was a big hack and had numerous problems with it that were not easily fixable without major work.  It was better to just ditch this and use one of the sister directories available in this project.
